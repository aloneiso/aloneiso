## About me

I'm Rishi, 17. I'm learning coding at my own speed. I don't act like a pro, I just try to understand things properly. Most of my day is normal stuff: school, a bit of code, talking with friends, overthinking, fixing small mistakes, and trying to be a little better.

## My developer journey

I started with basic coding and slowly moved toward things that feel fun, not overrated.

Right now I'm mainly into:

* **Python** for everything: scripts, small tools, automation
* **Crystal** because it feels like a fast, clean language that not many people talk about
* Other "underrated" or less common languages that I like to explore for fun

I don't care about buzzwords. I care about writing code I can read later without hating it.

## How I work

I keep it simple:

* Write a bit of Python as often as I can
* Try random ideas in Crystal or other small languages when I'm bored
* Focus on clean, short files instead of huge messy projects
* Learn by breaking and fixing things

## My circle (friends & real life)

I believe real friends are very few. 2 to 5 people. More than that usually turns into drama and wasted time. I prefer keeping only the people who are actually real with me.

Most of my mindset comes from real stuff: talks with my close friends, small fights, support, late-night chats, and daily routines. Nothing fake or over-edited.

## What I focus on

* Understanding basics properly instead of rushing
* Staying consistent, even if it's a small amount of work
* Keeping my life and code minimal and clean
* Doing things that actually feel like me, not what everyone else is doing
