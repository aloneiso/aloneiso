## About me

I'm Rishi, 17. I'm learning coding at my own pace and keeping things simple. I don't try to act like a pro. I just focus on getting better slowly. Most of what I do comes from daily life: studying, talking with friends, trying things, messing up, and improving.

## My developer journey

I started coding because I wanted to understand how things actually work. Nothing fancy. Just basics done properly.

Right now I'm mainly learning:

* C++ basics like pointers and memory
* Python for small scripts and automation
* JavaScript for simple web work

I prefer writing small, clean things instead of big, confusing projects.

## How I work

I keep my routine simple:

* Practice C++ a little every day
* Solve easy problems to build logic
* Make tiny scripts whenever I feel like it
* Keep things clean and understandable

## My circle (friends & real life)

I believe real friends are very few. 2 to 5 people. Anything more than that becomes drama and wasted time. I prefer keeping only the people who actually matter.

A lot of my growth comes from real conversations, arguments, support, and learning with my close friends. Nothing fake or exaggerated.

## What I focus on

* Understanding the basics properly
* Improving a little every day
* Staying consistent instead of chasing shortcuts
* Keeping life and work clean and minimal
